# TypeScript

## Status

accepted

## Context

I have been tasked with picking a programming language between Java, Python, Go and JavaScript.

Java and Go are heavy on boiler plate comparatively to Python and JavaScript.
Python has type-related quirks whereas JavaScript is typeless.
However JavaScript has an incredibly strong typesafe superset (TypeScript) with strict linting and efficient compiler. Additionally JavaScript is also fast, cross-platform compatible and, best of all, has an online editor in AWS, which makes manual fiddling hella easy (as opposed to C#).

## Decision

I have decided to program in JavaScript/TypeScript.

## Consequences

It'll be easy and fast to complete this micro project.
