# ESLint and Jest

## Status

accepted

## Context

I would like some easy linting and testing for this micro project.

## Decision

I've decided to use ESLint and Jest because these are familiar to me and easy to get started with minimal effort, while providing incredible value.

Since this project is micro the minimal effort is essential.

## Consequences

I now have linting and a testing framework. Yay! :D
